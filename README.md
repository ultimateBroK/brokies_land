## üí° What's This?

A ready-to-use Hyprland configuration for those of us who spent all our money on PC hardware and now can't afford to spend hours configuring our desktop. This is for the broke in wallet, not in spirit!

> "We may be broke, but our desktops don't have to look that way" - Brokie's Motto

## ‚ú® Features

- **Minimal Effort Required** - Because we're too lazy (or busy hustling) to configure everything
- **Looks Expensive** - Flex on your friends without spending a dime
- **Copy-Paste Ready** - Why work hard when you can work smart?
- **No Premium Addons** - Everything's free, as it should be

## üìÇ What's Inside

- **.config/hypr/** - Pre-configured Hyprland setup with hyprlock and hypridle
- **.config/waybar/** - Status bar that looks like it costs money (it doesn't)
- **.config/tofi/** - Application launcher that's lightweight yet stylish
- **.config/kitty/** - Terminal config that's both minimal and pretty
- **.config/dunst/** - Notification system that's clean and functionalaa
- **.config/wleave/** - Stylish logout/power menu for when you need to escape

## üîß Dependencies

Things you need to install (all free, thankfully):
- `hyprland` - The fancy compositor that burns GPU, not cash
- `waybar` - So people think you know what you're doing
- `tofi` - Minimal app launcher that saves resources and looks good
- `kitty` - Terminal that looks cooler than it needs to
- `dunst` - Notifications that don't look free (but are)
- `wleave` - Logout menu for the aesthetically broke
- `swww` - For those wallpaper transitions that scream "I'm not broke" (even though you are)
- `brightnessctl` - Control your screen brightness when you can't afford electricity
- `pamixer` - Audio controls that don't cost a cent

# Let someone else do the work
cp -r brokies_land/.config/* ~/.config/

# Start it up and pretend you built it yourself
Hyprland
```
