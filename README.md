## üí° What's This?

A ready-to-use Hyprland configuration for those of us who spent all our money on PC hardware and now can't afford to spend hours configuring our desktop. This is for the broke in wallet, not in spirit!

> "We may be broke, but our desktops don't have to look that way" - Brokie's Motto

## ‚ú® Features

- **Minimal Effort Required** - Because we're too lazy (or busy hustling) to configure everything
- **Looks Expensive** - Flex on your friends without spending a dime
- **Copy-Paste Ready** - Why work hard when you can work smart?
- **No Premium Addons** - Everything's free, as it should be

## üìÇ What's Inside

- **hypr/** - Pre-configured Hyprland setup so you don't have to do it yourself
- **waybar/** - Status bar that looks like it costs money (it doesn't)
- **rofi/** - Because typing commands is for people with time to spare
- **scripts/** - Automation for the "minimum effort" lifestyle
- **wallpapers/** - Free eye-candy (because art costs money we don't have)

## üîß Dependencies

Things you need to install (all free, thankfully):
- `hyprland` - The fancy compositor that burns GPU, not cash
- `waybar` - So people think you know what you're doing
- `rofi` - Click instead of type, save your energy
- `kitty` or `alacritty` - Terminals that look cooler than they need to
- `swww` - For those wallpaper transitions that scream "I'm not broke" (even though you are)

## üöÄ Quick Start

For the lazy and financially challenged:

```bash
# Steal this repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brokies_land.git

# Let someone else do the work
cp -r brokies_land/* ~/.config/

# Start it up and pretend you built it yourself
Hyprland
```

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

| Combo | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `SUPER + Return` | Opens terminal (for checking your bank balance) |
| `SUPER + Q` | Closes windows (like you close conversations about your finances) |
| `SUPER + Space` | App launcher (find free alternatives to paid software) |
| `SUPER + Shift + Q` | Quit Hyprland (when your landlord walks in) |
| `SUPER + F` | Fullscreen (hide all the error notifications) |
| `SUPER + Left/Right/Up/Down` | Navigate windows (avoid real-life navigation, it costs gas money) |
