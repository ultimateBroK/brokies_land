## üí° What's This?

A ready-to-use Hyprland configuration for those of us who spent all our money on PC hardware and now can't afford to spend hours configuring our desktop. This is for the broke in wallet, not in spirit!

> "We may be broke, but our desktops don't have to look that way" - Brokie's Motto
