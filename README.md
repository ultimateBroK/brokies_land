> "We may be broke, but our desktops? They're priceless." - The Brokie Manifesto

## ‚ú® Why You'll Love It

-   **Zero Effort Setup** - Because time is money, and you ain't got either to waste on configs.
-   **Looks Like a Million Bucks** - Impress your friends without emptying your already empty pockets.
-   **Copy-Paste Magic** - Why reinvent the wheel when you can just... borrow it?
-   **100% Free, Always** - No premium BS here. Just pure, unadulterated, free goodness.

## üóÇÔ∏è What's Inside the Box?

## üõ†Ô∏è Gear Up: Dependencies

### Core Essentials

The bread and butter (or ramen and water) of this setup:

-   `hyprland` - The compositor that proves you can have nice things without selling a kidney.
-   `xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland` - Because everyone deserves a portal... to a cooler desktop.

### The Bling (Bar)

-   `waybar` - Making you look like you know what you're doing, even if you don't.

### Terminal Time

-   `kitty` or `ghostty` - Terminals that are way too cool for their own good.

### Stay Notified

-   `dunst` - Notifications that are informative without being intrusive (or expensive).

### Launch It!

-   `tofi` - The minimalist app launcher that's big on style.

### File Wrangling

-   `nautilus` - File manager for keeping your digital life (and budget) in order.

### Lock It Down

-   `hyprlock` - A lock screen that screams "premium" without the price tag.
-   `hypridle` - The free alternative to actually paying attention.
-   `wlogout` and `wleave` - Because even logging out should be aesthetically pleasing.

### Eye Candy

-   `swww` - Wallpaper transitions that say, "I'm not broke," even if you are.
-   `grimblast` - Capture your awesome (and free) setup for bragging rights.
-   `nwg-look` - Polish your desktop to a mirror shine.
-   `kvantum` - Make your apps look like they cost more than your car.
-   `noto-fonts-cjk` - Fonts that add a touch of class to your broke existence.

### Theming
- `bibata-cursor-theme`: Cursor theme
- fluent-icon-theme-git`: Icon theme 
- ![Orchis-theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Orchis-theme): Shell theme (GTK theme)

> Clone the 2 above and install via script inside
### Clipboard Hero

-   `cliphist` - Clipboard manager that saves you from repeating yourself (and wasting precious time).

### Qt Corner

-   `qt5-wayland` - For those Qt5 apps you can't live without.
-   `qt6-wayland` - Future-proofing your broke life, one Qt6 app at a time.

### Polkit Power

-   `polkit-kde-agent` - The free bouncer for your system's VIP requests.

### Utility Belt

-   `brightnessctl` - Control your screen brightness and save those precious watts.
-   `playerctl` - Control your media without paying for a fancy remote.
-   `pavucontrol` - Audio control that makes you feel like a sound engineer.
-   `bluez` - Bluetooth support for your budget headphones.
-   `bluez-utils` - Bluetooth utilities for when you want to cut the cord (without cutting your budget).
    -   `jamesdsp` - A DSP for your audio that doesn't cost a dime
-   `gnome-clocks` - Wake up, brokies, watch out for alarms

### Browser

-   `zen-browser` - Because Chrome eats RAM for breakfast

### Code Editor

-   `visual-studio-code` - Editor to build that million-dollar app idea (someday)
-  `zed-preview` - An alternative to VSCode

### Time to Install (The Free Way)

#### Arch Linux (Using paru)

```bash
# One command to rule them all (the broke way)
paru -S hyprland xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland qt5-wayland qt6-wayland waybar kitty dunst tofi nautilus polkit-kde-agent swww brightnessctl grimblast-git hyprlock hypridle wleave-git wlogout playerctl pavucontrol cliphist nwg-look kvantum zen-browser-bin visual-studio-code-bin zed-preview-bin noto-fonts-cjk bluez bluez-utils ghostty jamesdsp bibata-cursor-theme fluent-icon-theme-git gnome-clocks
