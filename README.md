## üí° What's This?

A ready-to-use Hyprland configuration for those of us who spent all our money on PC hardware and now can't afford to spend hours configuring our desktop. This is for the broke in wallet, not in spirit!

> "We may be broke, but our desktops don't have to look that way" - Brokie's Motto

## ‚ú® Features

- **Minimal Effort Required** - Because we're too lazy (or busy hustling) to configure everything
- **Looks Expensive** - Flex on your friends without spending a dime
- **Copy-Paste Ready** - Why work hard when you can work smart?
- **No Premium Addons** - Everything's free, as it should be

## üìÇ What's Inside

- **.config/hypr/** - Pre-configured Hyprland setup with hyprlock and hypridle
- **.config/waybar/** - Status bar that looks like it costs money (it doesn't)
- **.config/tofi/** - Application launcher that's lightweight yet stylish
- **.config/kitty/** - Terminal config that's both minimal and pretty
- **.config/dunst/** - Notification system that's clean and functional
